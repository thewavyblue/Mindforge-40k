I'm an avid tabletop gamer, but I currently don't dedicate enough time to playing because I'm too busy learning to code! This creates a problem when it comes round to 'throwing dice' because I struggle to confidently recall my army rules and stats quickly or efficiently enough, making every game last twice as long (much to my opponent's dismay).

This is where the idea for this app came from; what is essentially a quiz / flashcard app in order to help with memory recall and reduce time spent swiping through pages looking for rules.

It uses JavaScript logic, with vanilla HTML and CSS for the frontend UI. The visual style is based on the official WH40k app, and as I learn more web dev fundamentals, I plan to incorporate this to add further functionality to the app.

With new functionalities comes more relationships and design decisions, so future design development in Figma will need to come before code development.

I plan to consistently test the app with a small focus group and take on board feedback to eventually create an app with a complete set of features.
