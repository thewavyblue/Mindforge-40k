I'm an avid tabletop gamer, but I currently don't dedicate enough time to playing because I'm too busy learning to code! This creates a problem when it comes round to 'throwing dice' because I can never recall my army rules and stats quickly or efficiently enough, making every game last twice as long (much to my opponent's dismay). This is where the idea for this app came from; what is essentially a quiz / flashcard app in order to help with memory recall and reduce time spent swiping through pages looking for rules.
